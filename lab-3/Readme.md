# Encryption & Hashing using OpenSSL


To begin with, let's set up a tool for symmetric encryption and hashing, leveraging OpenSSL, a widely used cryptographic toolkit. OpenSSL is renowned for its implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols, crucial for securing web communication. Written primarily in C, it offers fundamental cryptographic functionalities along with utility functions. Additionally, it supports integration with various programming languages through available wrappers.

Now, before diving into the encryption and hashing processes, we need a hex editor. For Unix-based systems like MacOS, ghex is a popular choice. To install ghex on MacOS, you can follow these steps:

```bash
brew install ghex
```

Given that [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is already installed, we can easily acquire openssl to access its utility functions. While openssl typically comes pre-installed in most Unix operating systems, it's prudent to ensure it's functioning correctly. You can verify openssl by executing the following command:

```bash
openssl
```

The given tasks are provided in separte folders. And the documentation of each tasks are given on a Markdown file in each respective directory. For running the commands, Change your directory to each folder and start

- [Task 1](./task-1/Readme.md)
- [Task 2](./task-2/Readme.md)
- [Task 3](./task-3/Readme.md)
- [Task 4](./task-4/Readme.md)
- [Task 5](./task-5/Readme.md)
- [Task 6](./task-6/Readme.md)
